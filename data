The Next Big Players in the Crypto Space: Aave (AAVE), Ripple (XRP), and Meme Moguls (MGLS)
Table of Contents
New cryptos are created daily, but only a few hold the same potential as Aave (AAVE), Ripple (XRP), and Meme Moguls (MGLS). While Aave and Ripple take on traditional finance, Meme Moguls is set to change the billion-dollar meme industry. Let's dive into these three cryptocurrencies and see why they are the next big players in the crypto space.

Meme Moguls (MGLS): Pioneering the Meme-Backed Stock Market
Meme Moguls is set to introduce the world's first meme-backed stock market/exchange. Users of the platform will be able to buy, sell, and trade meme-backed stocks to profit from the ever-growing popularity of internet memes.
Meme Moguls encourages users to step into the shoes of renowned moguls like Elon Musk and Warren Buffett. It offers a space where users can harness the viral nature of memes to make strategic investment decisions to generate profits.
Meme Moguls' ecosystem encompasses several unique features tailored to the interests of meme enthusiasts and traders. For example, the Meme Moguls Fantasy Trader adds a competitive edge to the platform by allowing users to create and participate in meme-based trading competitions.
Then there's the Mogul Land, where users can jump into a metaverse experience filled with mining and staking activities to earn in-game rewards. Meme Moguls' decentralized platform is supported by its native currency, MGLS, which can be used for all transactions within the ecosystem.
MGLS can now be bought for just $0.0021 in the first presale stage. This time-limited opportunity allows users to get in on the ground floor before subsequent price rises and the official exchange launch in the coming months.
In summary, Meme Moguls is revolutionizing how we think about investing and interacting with memes. Analysts predict that MGLS could soar by 100x as the platform gains traction and becomes a mainstream player in the crypto space.
Aave (AAVE) Pushes the Envelope in Decentralized Finance
The world is shifting toward decentralized finance as people seek more control over their digital assets. Aave is one of the pioneers in this movement, offering a decentralized lending platform that allows users to borrow and lend crypto assets easily.
Aave has gained significant popularity since its launch in 2020, with $4.54 billion currently locked inside the protocol. Aave V3 is the newest version with more cross-protocol integrations, increased security, and improved decentralization. Aave V3 has a TVL of $3.40 billion.
The price of Aave has climbed from $51 in mid-September to a current price of $97.24 at the start of December. This 90% gain has been driven by the growing demand for decentralized finance solutions and Aave's continuous innovation.
But what's next? The Aave chart shows that the $120 level is a crucial resistance level. Break this, and we could see long-term prices heading to $100. This would translate to a market cap of roughly $14.60 billion — a realistic target that could be reached by 2025.
Ripple (XRP) Continues to Shape Cross-Border Transactions
Ripple isn't a new player in the crypto space. The company has been around since 2012 and is known for its cross-border payment solutions. However, Ripple is a few years behind where it should be due to the legal battles they faced with the SEC.
With this regulatory issue in the back mirror, Ripple is looking to regain lost ground and make significant strides in the global payments market. The company recently partnered with Onafiq, a leading payments provider in Africa, to expand its cross-border remittance network further.
The #XRParmy is another string to Ripple's bow. This group of dedicated investors always pushes for XRP adoption, believing the token will rise to $1,000 per coin. While this sounds like an unrealistic price target, it shows confidence in Ripple and its technology.
Ripple is trading at $0.60 with a market cap of $32.5 billion. Chart analysts note that the next resistance level is $0.90, and if the bulls break that, the price will likely surge through $1.00 and attempt to reach the all-time high of $3.84. Keep an eye on Ripple as it continues to attract partnerships and expand its presence in the global payments market.

ChatGPT Offers Price Projections for Ripple (XRP) and InQubeta (QUBE)
Cryptocurrencies are dynamic: new projects are launched daily and existing ones continually gain ground.
CoinMarketCap data reveals that there are over 20,000 unique projects, with new ones continually launching on multiple blockchains around the world. However, while there are numerous currencies to choose from, XRP, the currency that powers the XRP Ledger (XRPL), and InQubeta (QUBE) are in focus.
Although there have been difficult questions about whether AI-powered chatbots like ChatGPT can accurately value crypto assets by analyzing large data sets, analysts asked the algorithm about the price outlook for XRP and QUBE and their growth potential in the future. .
The results were interesting:
ChatGPT analyzes XRP and its growth potential
After analyzing relevant data, the OpenAI and Microsoft chatbot is “cautiously optimistic” and notes that XRP could grow in the coming days, floating upwards as cryptocurrencies find tailwinds.
XRP rose as high as $3.20 in the previous cycle before contracting. The bearish trend was mainly due to the crypto winter of 2022 as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) sued some of Ripple’s top executives, including Brad Garlinghouse.
As a result, XRP liquidity fell. Still, the coin managed to maintain its position in the top 10 by market capitalization despite being delisted from multiple exchanges in the United States.
However, with a judge ruling favorably in July, XRP is now in an uptrend, rising higher. Although $1 remains a critical resistance level that needs to be overcome, greater adoption of Ripple’s solutions, including on-demand liquidity (ODL), could support prices going forward. If Ripple finds more ODL partners, XRP could rise above $1 and even reach $3.2 in the coming months.
While there are advantages, there are also notable disadvantages that XRP investors should be aware of. Although there is regulatory clarity on the currency, it remains to be seen whether XRPL, the native XRP blockchain, would maintain decisive advantages over emerging blockchains competing with legacy designs. . Options like Stellar (XLM) could slow adoption.
ChatGPT analyzes the possibilities of InQubeta
The attention captured by InQubeta in the ongoing pre-sale seems to have attracted analysts. So far, InQubeta has sold over 608 million QUBE, the project’s native ERC-20 token, raising over $6.3 million as a result.
Supporters are optimistic about the project, citing its potential as a gateway for cryptocurrency investors to take advantage of the expansion of artificial intelligence (AI). InQubeta offers a portal where AI cryptocurrency founders can easily raise funds from cryptocurrency holders.
InQubeta leverages audited smart contracts and the security of Ethereum. Approved crypto AI startups can generate opportunities like fractional NFTs, tradable on the internal NFT market. QUBE is used as a medium of exchange and governance token. As such, the owners can vote on the proposals, thus becoming directly involved in the evolution of the project.
ChatGPT notes that the project has the potential to become a notable decentralized finance (DeFi) project once it launches. However, the performance of QUBE depends on the execution of the roadmap. Investors are optimistic and expect the token to rise in the coming months as the crypto market recovers from 2022 losses.
Even amid this optimism, investors should keep in mind that InQubeta is a new project. As such, its success would be largely determined by its developers’ experience, adoption, community, and its ability to deliver distinguished solutions in a highly competitive arena.
Conclusion
Taking the above into account, the chatbot has refrained from giving specific numerical predictions. Still, while the model remains bullish on XRP and InQubeta (QUBE), investor due diligence is vital. Consequently, interested traders and investors should do extensive research before gaining exposure, aware that past performance does not guarantee future price trajectories.

XRP outperforms Ethereum in 2023 despite legal troubles
2023 proved to be a rollercoaster ride for XRP (XRP), one of the biggest crypto altcoins.
This gripping journey was significantly influenced by a series of both positive and negative market-altering events, primarily revolving around the protracted legal battle between Ripple and the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
Amidst regulatory uncertainties and legal challenges, XRP defied the odds to showcase an impressive surge in its price throughout the year. Surpassing the performance of Ethereum (ETH), XRP’s remarkable ascent underscored the enduring allure of this popular altcoin among investors.
XRP may be on the verge of ‘new, long-term uptrend’
In a December 6 analysis post, a popular X account that conducts crypto technical analysis (TA), Cryptoes, revealed something that not many cryptocurrency enthusiasts have noticed.
Indeed, Cryptoes said that XRP has been outperforming Ethereum in 2023. As shown in his TradingView chart, the crypto token gained more than 116% this year, or $0.33, compared to the 91.9% surge seen in ETH.

“Given how #XRP has performed over the past few years; this is not something to brag about but wanted to bring it to your attention regardless.” – the analyst noted in his post.
“XRP has been outperforming ETH in 2023.” – he added.
The trading expert acknowledged that XRP has a long way to go to catch up to Ethereum’s market cap, but he hopes the crypto asset is “on the verge of a fresh, new, and long-term uptrend.”
XRP potentially forming a bullish pattern
Commenting on the same post by Cryptoes, one X user suggested that XRP’s price action may be forming a Cup and Handle, which is typically considered a bullish pattern. Cryptoes confirmed the user’s assessment.
This formation consists of a rounded bottom (the “cup”) followed by a consolidation period and a smaller upward move (the “handle”). Technical analysts usually view this pattern as bullish, signaling a potential trend reversal and indicating that an asset’s price may experience a significant upward breakout after the handle formation.
At the time of writing on December 7, XRP’s price was changing hands at $0.64, down 0.4% on the day. The cryptocurrency gained more than 4.7% over the past week, but its monthly performance sits at -10.8%.

Uphold launches self-custody wallet that supports Ripple's XRP token
Uphold is releasing a self-custody wallet called Vault that will initially support Ripple's XRP +2.50% token and offer a feature for users afraid of losing their private keys.
The company said that in the past, if a person loses their private keys, their funds are lost forever. With Vault, Uphold said users "can initiate a key replacement that will enable them to recover access to their assets," according to a statement. Uphold's mission with Vault is to provide the "convenience of centralized financial (CeFi) applications ... combined with the security of self-custody."
"Until now, no one has offered self custody that is practical for the ordinary user. With Vault, we’ve stripped away the complexity to give users full control over their assets, without sacrificing the benefit of easy trading on a centralized platform," Uphold CEO Simon McLoughlin said in a statement.
Bitcoin support forthcoming

Uphold is first rolling out Vault in beta, with the expectation of a full roll out during early 2024. Uphold also plans to add Bitcoin support during the first quarter of next year.
Launched in 2015, Uphold serves over 10 million customers in more than 140 countries. In the U.S. the company is regulated by FinCen along with state regulators, it also said. Servicing more than 200 currencies, crypto and fiat, Uphold said it has "powered" more than $4 billion in transactions.
With hacks still prevalent and some faith lost in centralized exchanges in the wake of FTX's collapse, security and protecting one's digital assets continues to be an important issue. On-chain custody protocol Safe (formerly Gnosis Safe) also announced it has teamed up with digital asset banking group Sygnum and recovery service provider Coincover in order to launch an optional crypto recovery service for users.

Revolutionizing Digital Inheritance: Inheriti Launches on XRP Ledger, Redefining Security and Accessibility
In a momentous stride within the crypto sphere, Inheriti, a pioneering digital inheritance platform, is set to redefine the landscape with its launch on the XRP Ledger. This move marks a significant breakthrough for both the XRP Ledger and Ripple Labs Inc., promising transformative changes in how digital assets and data are securely managed and inherited.
An innovative brainchild of Anodos, Inheriti’s collaboration with Safe Haven heralds a new era of security and access management. Their integration of the SHA token into the XRP Ledger ensures fortified protection for digital assets, including Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), promising a revolutionary safeguarding solution.
The partnership between Anodos and Safe Haven boasts a strategic synergy, intending to introduce the SHA token on the XRPL’s Decentralized Exchange (DEX) and the forthcoming Automated Market Maker (AMM). Alongside this, the development of AnodoSwap, a comprehensive trading and portfolio management platform on the XRPL, stands as a testament to their commitment to facilitating seamless transactions and liquidity enhancement.
Reports indicate the phased rollout of this partnership, with the issuance of 10 million SHA tokens scheduled on the XRPL network in January 2024. The subsequent phase, following the launch of the EVM sidechain on XRPL, envisions integrating Inheriti into Safe Haven’s SafeSwap, further fortifying the ecosystem’s security and accessibility.
The recent successful audit of the XRPL’s EVM sidechain by cybersecurity firm Bishop Fox signifies a crucial leap forward. Once operational, users can conveniently create Inheriti plans by utilizing SHA tokens through the Xumm wallet, offering a user-friendly experience in managing digital inheritances.
Noteworthy insights from a Crypto News Flash report shed light on the distribution of XRP transactions, revealing intriguing patterns in transaction values. The concentration of high-value remittances on weekdays, as evidenced by graphs from the XRP block explorer, XRPScan, underscores the deep liquidity pool that Inheriti stands to gain access to in the long run.
Originally launched on the VeChain mainnet in 2020, Inheriti stands as an avant-garde digital inheritance solution designed for all user levels. It employs a robust 3-layer encryption topology to ensure the utmost security in transferring access to digital assets, NFTs, and sensitive data across various cold storage devices.
The simplicity of Inheriti’s process lies in its ability to encrypt and distribute data into unreadable, secret, and encrypted shares. These pieces, scattered across multiple cold storage devices, can be reconstructed by the designated safe key holder, enabling seamless data decryption.
Recent reports from Crypto News Flash revealed intriguing insights into the distribution of XRP transactions, highlighting a notable pattern in transaction values. Contrary to consistent remittances observed on weekdays and holidays, the analysis unveiled a concentration of high-value XRP transactions predominantly on weekdays. Graphical representations from XRP block explorer XRPScan illustrate these findings, offering a comprehensive view of daily XRP-based transaction statistics. These insights underscore the deep liquidity pool that Inheriti stands to gain access to in the long run.
Originally launched on the VeChain mainnet in September 2020, Inheriti stands as a pioneering digital inheritance solution designed to bolster security in transferring access to a spectrum of digital assets, from social media accounts to NFTs and digital data. The platform employs a robust 3-layer topology, leveraging encryption and secure storage mechanisms, including blockchain and cold storage.
Accessible to users across diverse technical backgrounds, Inheriti simplifies the process by fragmenting data into unreadable, secret, and encrypted shares, which are then dispersed across various cold storage devices. The safe key holder retains the ability to reconstruct these shares within Inheriti, decrypting the data securely.
This momentous integration of Inheriti onto the XRP Ledger signifies a paradigm shift in the way digital inheritances are managed and secured. With its robust security measures and user-friendly approach, Inheriti is poised to empower individuals worldwide in safeguarding and transferring their digital legacies.
